= ChrootCompiler

The ChrootCompiler is a tool designed to compile software directly on images executed in Chroot. It facilitates direct emulation of various architectures and libraries with minimal setup.

== Features

- Directly compile software within Chroot environments
- Emulate different architectures and libraries effortlessly
- Simplify the setup process for building and compiling software

== Usage

=== Preparation

First, clone the ChrootCompiler repository and set up the necessary files:

git clone https://github.com/OpenHD/OpenHD-ChrootCompiler
mkdir -p OpenHD-ChrootCompiler/additionalFiles
cp YOURFILES OpenHD-ChrootCompiler/additionalFiles/
echo $CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY > OpenHD-ChrootCompiler/additionalFiles/cloudsmith_api_key.txt
touch build_chroot.sh OpenHD-ChrootCompiler/additionalFiles/

- Replace `YOURFILES` with the files you need to include.
- Ensure you have your `CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY` ready and place it in the `additionalFiles` directory.

=== Building

Update your system and install the required dependencies:

sudo apt update
sudo bash install_dep.sh

Then, run the build script with the necessary parameters:

sudo bash ./build.sh x20 $API_KEY DISTRO FLAVOR


- `x20` is an example parameter for the script.
- Replace `$API_KEY` with your actual API key.
- Specify the `DISTRO` and `FLAVOR` according to your needs.

=== Executing Commands in Chroot

Any commands listed in the `build_chroot.sh` file will be executed within the Chroot environment when the tool is run. Ensure that your `build_chroot.sh` script is properly configured and placed in the `additionalFiles` directory.

== Example `build_chroot.sh`

Here is an example of what your `build_chroot.sh` might look like:

#!/bin/bash

Example commands to run in chroot
apt-get update
apt-get install -y build-essential
make


Adjust the script as needed for your specific build and compilation tasks.
